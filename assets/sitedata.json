      "content": "The Murder of John Doe\n\nJohn Doe left work on April 15, 1990 shortly after 5pm. Witnesses reported seeing him approximately half an hour later. There are no credible reports of his whereabouts after this time.\n\n2 months later, a body is recovered from a drainage ditch on the western edge of Doetown. Dental records identify the body as that of John Doe.\n\nThe Investigation\n\nEarly on, the investigation focused on Jim Davies, an acquaintance of John’s with a prior record of violent assault. Police were initially unable to confirm Davies’ alibi, though, in subsequent weeks he would be cleared via surveillance footage obtained from a business across town.\n\nAfter the clearing of Davies the investigation stalled, with some detectives believing that John may have taken his own life, a theory with which the family strongly disagreed, while others, still suspicious of Davies, began to look into his associates.\n",
